Building:
=========

The Stablebox build process is similar to the Linux kernel build:

  make menuconfig     # This creates a file called ".config"
  make                # This creates the "stablebox" executable
  make install        # or make PREFIX=/path/from/root install

The full list of configuration and install options is available by typing:

  make help

Quick Start:
============

To enable all features, use "make defconfig", which produces the largest
general-purpose configuration.  (It's allyesconfig minus debugging options,
optional packaging choices, and a few special-purpose features requiring
extra configuration to use.)

  make defconfig
  make
  PATH= ./stablebox ash


Configuring Stablebox:
====================

Stablebox is optimized for size, but enabling the full set of functionality
still results in a fairly large executable -- more than 1 megabyte when
statically linked.  To save space, stablebox can be configured with only the
set of applets needed for each environment.  The minimal configuration, with
all applets disabled, produces a 4k executable.  (It's useless, but very small.)

The manual configurator "make menuconfig" modifies the existing configuration.
(For systems without ncurses, try "make config" instead.) The two most
interesting starting configurations are "make allnoconfig" (to start with
everything disabled and add just what you need), and "make defconfig" (to
start with everything enabled and remove what you don't need).  If menuconfig
is run without an existing configuration, make defconfig will run first to
create a known starting point.

Other starting configurations (mostly used for testing purposes) include
"make allbareconfig" (enables all applets but disables all optional features),
"make allyesconfig" (enables absolutely everything including debug features),
and "make randconfig" (produce a random configuration).

Configuring Stablebox produces a file ".config", which can be saved for future
use.  Run "make oldconfig" to bring a .config file from an older version of
stablebox up to date.

Installing Stablebox:
===================

Stablebox is a single executable that can behave like many different commands,
and Stablebox uses the name it was invoked under to determine the desired
behavior.  (Try "mv stablebox ls" and then "./ls -l".)

Installing stablebox consists of creating symlinks (or hardlinks) to the stablebox
binary for each applet enabled in stablebox, and making sure these symlinks are
in the shell's command $PATH.  Running "make install" creates these symlinks,
or "make install-hardlinks" creates hardlinks instead (useful on systems with
a limited number of inodes).  This install process uses the file
"stablebox.links" (created by make), which contains the list of enabled applets
and the path at which to install them.

Installing links to stablebox is not always necessary.  The special applet name
"stablebox" (or with any optional suffix, such as "stablebox-static") uses the
first argument to determine which applet to behave as, for example
"./stablebox cat LICENSE".  (Running the stablebox applet with no arguments gives
a list of all enabled applets.) The standalone shell can also call stablebox
applets without links to stablebox under other names in the filesystem.  You can
also configure a standaone install capability into the stablebox base applet,
and then install such links at runtime with one of "stablebox --install" (for
hardlinks) or "stablebox --install -s" (for symlinks).
